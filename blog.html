                    Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p>Certainly, here's a shorter explanation of the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const` without code snippets:

                    1. `var`:
                       - Function-scoped or globally if declared outside functions.
                       - Hoisted to the top of the function or global scope.
                       - Allows re-declaration within the same scope.
                    
                    2. `let`:
                       - Block-scoped (inside curly braces).
                       - Hoisted to the top of the block but not initialized.
                       - Does not allow re-declaration within the same block scope.
                    
                    3. `const`:
                       - Block-scoped.
                       - Hoisted but not initialized.
                       - Variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned, but for objects and arrays, their properties or elements can be modified.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, here are the use cases for `null` and `undefined`:

                    1. `null`:
                       - Explicitly set by a developer to indicate the absence of value or an empty object.
                       - Often used to initialize variables or properties when no value is appropriate.
                    
                    2. `undefined`:
                       - Automatically assigned by JavaScript to variables that have been declared but not initialized.
                       - Represents the default value for function parameters not provided by the caller.
                       - Typically indicates a variable's absence or an error in the code.</p>

                    What do you mean by REST API?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content"> 
                  <p>REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural constraints and principles used to design networked applications and web services. It is based on a stateless, client-server communication model and is widely used for building scalable and maintainable web services. Here's a brief explanation of its key concepts:

                    1. **Resources**: In a REST API, everything is treated as a resource, which can be an object, data, or service. Each resource is uniquely identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
                    
                    2. **HTTP Methods**: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods for operations on resources. The most common methods include:
                       - GET: Retrieve data from the server.
                       - POST: Create a new resource on the server.
                       - PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
                       - DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
                       - PATCH: Partially update a resource.
                    
                    3. **Stateless**: REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
                    
                    4. **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML), and clients can request the representation that best suits their needs using HTTP headers (e.g., `Accept` and `Content-Type`).
                    
                    5. **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, making it easier to work with and discover APIs. This includes the consistent use of HTTP methods and status codes.
                    
                    6. **Client-Server Architecture**: REST separates the client (the user interface) from the server (the data store and business logic), allowing them to evolve independently and improve scalability.
                    
                    7. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
                    
                    REST APIs are commonly used in web development to expose data and services over the internet in a scalable and interoperable way. They are often used for building web applications, mobile apps, and integrations between different systems and services.</p>
